		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Mirchi Bajji is a popular, quick & easy to make, and addictive Indian snack recipe that is crispy and crunchy on the outside.</p>
		<p>Mirchi means green chilies, and bajji means deep-fried fritters. These are some of the best and most popular Indian recipes served with coffee/tea or as a side with your meal.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>8 Long green chilies</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon Salt</li>
			<li>1 cup Besan / Gram Flour / Chickpea Flour</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon Hing / Asafoetida</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon Cumin seeds</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon Red chile powder</li>
			<li>Water (approx. ½ to ¾ cup)</li>
			<li>Oil for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Cut ¼ inch at the end and slit the green chilies lengthwise, leaving the portion near the top/stem undisturbed. You can discard the seeds or keep them as it is. Do not discard the stem.</li>
			<li>In a pan, add chickpea flour, hing, cumin seeds, red chile powder, and salt. Add water little by little and whisk to form a medium-thick lump-free batter.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a pan for frying on medium flame. Once the oil is hot, dip each chile in the batter and then drop them in hot oil, three to four chilies at a time, depending on the size of the pan.</li>
			<li>Cook until it becomes crisp and golden brown on all sides, flipping it a couple of times during the process. The bhajis will take approximately 4 to 5 minutes to develop golden brown color and a crispy texture.</li>
			<li>Transfer the bhajis to a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Repeat the process for the remaining chilies</li>
			<li>Serve hot with a cup of coffee or tea, and enjoy.</li>
		</ol>
